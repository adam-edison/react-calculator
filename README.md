# react-calculator
calculator app built in react

## Background

I wanted a TDD style approach, but I also wanted the end result to look good.
This way I can learn testing, applying core functionality of React to a small problem, and fill in CSS gaps all in one go.

* Follows [TDD tutorial here, first](https://blog.alexandrudanpop.dev/posts/creating-a-calculator-app-with-react-and-tdd-277/)
* Then follows [tutorial here](https://www.sitepoint.com/react-tutorial-build-calculator-app/), to get better visual results and include more features
* Continues to add more functionality and change look and feel, and test knowledge further
